<h1>'I Was Wrong, It Was My Mistake': PM Modi Takes Dig at Mamata Banerjee at Bengal Rally</h1>

<p align="justify">
Kolkata: Returning to West Bengal for the fifth time this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said he misunderstood Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to be a woman with simple values when she had in fact unleashed “anti-people” policies on the people of the state.

Addressing a public rally at Buniadpur in South Dinajpur, Modi said, “You trusted your speed breaker didi (Mamata) but she betrayed you. This is not your fault. Before becoming PM, even I thought that she is a ‘Sadagi ki Murat’ (idol of simplicity). But after I became the PM, I got to know more about her and today, my head is hung in shame with her anti-people policies in Bengal. I was wrong. It was my mistake”.
