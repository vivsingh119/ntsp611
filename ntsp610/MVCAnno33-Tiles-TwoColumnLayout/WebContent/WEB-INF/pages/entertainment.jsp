In a recent interaction, Arbaaz said that he was very surprised when he went on the first day of the shoot.

Arbaaz said that after 'Dabangg 2', Salman did a lot of work and it has been seven years, but the moment he puts on that moustache and gave the first shot, he thought this man lives this character. It didn't take him a second to get the same attitude and dialect. He was like, 'Wow, this guy has made this character his own.

Along with Salman, the film also features Sonakshi Sinha as the female lead and Sudeep as the antagonist. After completing the first schedule in Maheshwar, the team is now headed to Mumbai to start the second schedule.
