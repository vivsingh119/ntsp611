 <p align="justify">
  Time is running out for the Rajasthan Royals (RR). They should’ve planned the chase better against the Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) and now will have to win every match from here on to stay in the contention for the playoffs. The challenge will get stiff for them as the Royals will host the Mumbai Indians (MI) at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.
Mumbai are on a roll at the moment having won six matches out of nine and are sitting pretty at the second position in the points table. They are coming off a thumping 40-run win over the Delhi Capitals (DC) and adapted well to the conditions the other day at Kotla. Though the Royals have given them tough competition over the last couple of years and Rohit Sharma’s men would love to break the hoodoo.
Ajinkya Rahane, on the other hand, moved down the order as Rahul Tripathi opened the innings. But him coming out to bat at four with the team needing 86 off just 50 balls wasn’t a wise move one felt. The likes of Ashton Turner and Stuart Binny should’ve been promoted and the Royals simply need to take better decisions when it comes to such moments.
